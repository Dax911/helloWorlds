# Hello World with Bun.js runtime

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with Bun.

## Getting Started
This is just a fun hello world application I built for a demo in the office.  Feel free to rebase or use this as a demo.

### Cloning the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dax911/helloWorlds.git
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Contributing

The easiest way to contribute is one of two ways.  This can be done very easily. Looking at this Github page and either clicking the Fork button in the upper corner and making your own edits or by cloning this repo directly and creating your own branch.  Here is a great little article on the difference between the two.[https://www.theserverside.com/answer/Git-fork-vs-clone-Whats-the-difference]

For the purpose of this lesson you must make changes to the repo in order to use git.  Feel free to just edit the following then practice pushing.

```bash
Hell my name is Alice and my favorite food is.
```

Changing this should not affect any code.


If you want to contribute and change the code I have several issues open that should be simple changes.  Feel free to give them a try and practice a Pull Request too.  If you also want to use this repo for the Hello World assignment please do.  This resource is here for everyone and all code is built on new lessons and knowledge.  

Bonus: If you know Next.js then you know that you don't JavaScript/TypeScript to run on the server side.  Please checkout the Next.js docs if you want to rewrite the Hello World logic in another language.  

Do not hesitate to open any issues as you need help.  I will online all day.  Other students and staff will also be able to see an issue so everyone can help out.

Welcome to Github... where you will spend the rest of your career. LOL ;)
