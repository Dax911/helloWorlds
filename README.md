# Next.js with Bun runtime

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with Bun.

## Getting Started
This is just a fun hello world applciation I built for a demo in the office.  Feel free to rebase or use this as a demo.

### Cloning the repo

```sh
bun create next ./app
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
